These don't work with current versions of Warsow / Warfork.

- rduel - RocketDuel, 1v1 with control points, infinite RL and GL. Works with Warsow v0.62
- xdo - Xanthus Team Domination - Like Domination, with a different scoring system, weapon changes (LG catches players on fire for example), unique classes with abilities, and a shop containing new unique upgrades and items. Doesn't seem to work with Warsow v0.62 but should've been from around that time.

I believe XDO contains a Mine Model from another Warsow gametype, I would need to look into it's source/licensing.
